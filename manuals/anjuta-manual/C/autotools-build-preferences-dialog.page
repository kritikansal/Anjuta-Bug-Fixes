  <p>
    The dialog allows you to set global options for building files.

      <title><gui>Run several commands at a time</gui></title>
      <p><app>make</app> is able to run several compilations at the same time.
      It decreases build time when having a multi-core processor but could
      trigger some issues so this can be enabled or disabled with this check box.</p>

      <title><gui>Continue on errors</gui></title>
      <p>By default <app>make</app> stops as soon as it gets an error, it can be
      faster to continue and get errors for all files in one step. You have to check this
      check box to get this behavior.</p>

      <title><gui>Translate messages</gui></title>
      <p>By default errors and warnings message are translated. It has two
      drawbacks though. In order to recognize errors and warnings the
      translation of <app>Anjuta</app> and the compiler should perfectly match.
      Moreover, it is often more difficult to find help on the internet when
      searching translated messages as they are much less common. Unchecking
      this check box allows to disable translation.</p>

      <title><gui>Highlight build warnings and errors in editor</gui></title>
      <p>Errors and warnings during the build are displayed and highlighted in
      the message window. By checking this option, they are highlighted in the
      editor too.</p>

    <item>
      <title><gui>Install as root</gui></title>
      <p>Installing a program needs to copy files into system directories which are
      often not writable by users. If this check box is checked, you can choose
      to use <cmd>sudo</cmd> or <cmd>su</cmd> before installing the files
      to acquire enough right to do it.</p>
