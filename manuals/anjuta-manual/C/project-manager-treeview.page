  <title>View a Project</title>

  <p>A project is represented by a tree, the root item corresponds
  to the project while children represent programs, libraries, directories
  and source files. Each item can have properties allowing to set more details
  like project version, compiler flags or installation directories.
  These item are divided in several categories, depending on the backend
  not all are available:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Root</title>
      <p>There is only one node of this kind. It represents the project
      itself. It is the place where you can set project wide properties
      like the project name or the project version.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Module</title>
      <p>This is a set of packages used in autotools project. They appear
      as children of the root node to represent all modules defined and
      as children of each target using them. For more details, see
      <link xref="project-manager-module-new"/>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Package</title>
      <p>This is a packaged library used in autotools project. They appear
      as children of each module. For more details, see
      <link xref="project-manager-library"/>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Folder</title>
      <p>This is used to group targets allowing to set common
      properties. They are often implemented by sub directories.
      For more details, see <link xref="project-manager-folder"/>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Target</title>
      <p>It groups files and define how they are used.
      There are several kinds of targets, by example program, library or data,
      corresponding to different use of the child files.
      They often represent generated project files like compiled programs or
      libraries. For more details see <link xref="project-manager-target"/>.</p>
	
      <note style="tip">
        <p>You can drag and drop targets at the beginning of the project tree view
        to create a shortcut allowing to access them more easily. By default all
        program targets are already put here.</p>
      </note>

    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Source</title>
      <p>Each source file is represented by a item in the project view. The use
      of each file depends on its parent target. All children of a program
      target are compiled to generate it. While children of a data target are
      only copied to a directory when the project is installed.
      For more details see <link xref="project-manager-source"/>.</p>
