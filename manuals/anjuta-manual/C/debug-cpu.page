  <title>CPU</title>

  <section>
    <title>View CPU registers</title>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>From the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>View</gui>
        <gui>Registers</gui></guiseq> to open the <gui>Register</gui>
        window.</p>
      </item>
    </steps>

    <p>Registers whose values have changed since the last stop are in red. It is
    possible to change the value of any register by clicking in the value
    column and entering a new value.</p>

  <section>
    <title>View memory</title>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>From the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>View</gui>
        <gui>Memory</gui></guiseq> to open the <gui>Memory</gui>
        window.</p>
      </item>
    </steps>

    <p>The first column displays memory addresses in hexadecimal, the second
    displays memory contents in hexadecimal and the last column shows
    memory contents in ASCII.</p>
    <p>The addressing space of even a 32-bit microprocessor is very large
    (4 gigabytes), so it is very difficult to go to a particular address
    with the scrollbar. But you can click the right mouse button and select
    <gui>Go to address</gui> to get a small edit box where you can enter an
    address in hexadecimal.</p>

  <section>
    <title>View Disassembly</title>


    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>From the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>View</gui>
        <gui>Disassembly</gui></guiseq> to open the <gui>Disassembly</gui>
        window.</p>
      </item>
    </steps>

    <p>The first column displays addresses in hexadecimal. In the second column,
    you can have a label starting at the beginning of the line and ending with
    a colon or a assembly-language instruction indented by 4 space characters.</p>

    <p>The position in the disassembly window will be changed to the program
    counter value when the program is stopped.</p>

    <p>The addressing space of even a 32-bit microprocessor is very large
    (4 gigabytes), so it is very difficult to go to a particular address
    with the scrollbar. But you can click the right mouse button and select
    <gui>Go to address</gui> to get a small edit box where you can enter an
    address in hexadecimal.</p>
