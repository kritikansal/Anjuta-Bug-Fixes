Anjuta 3.10.0 (September 23, 2013) -- James Liggett

This is a new stable version of Anjuta and all users should update to this
version as all 3.8.x versions become unsupported at this point.

Summary of the major changes between 3.8.x and 3.10:

- Various bug fixes across many different plugins, including git, debug-manager,
  document-manager, symbol-db glade, project-wizard and libanjuta. See the 
  shortlog for complete details. 

- Several updates to the git plugin, including an integrated diff viewer in the
  status pane. The command bar and dock are also packed together and most panes
  have right-click context menus.

- The beginnings of a Windows port. This work is in its very early stages and 
  is not really usable yet.

- The document manager has a Close Others option accessible by right clicking 
  on a document tab that will close all but the selected document.

  thing.
* Performances improvement in sdb_engine_second_pass_update_heritage () using

* Lookup of dynamic queries takes care of sym_info parameters and of 
  parameters passed to functions. The compiled GdaStatements are stored in an 
  array of GTree (of GTree(s)). Some parameters, as the filter_kinds,
